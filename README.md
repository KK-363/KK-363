I recently, in December 2022, completed Nucamp's Complete Software Engineering Bootcamp to update my coding skill.  Coding is something I really enjoy, with my main interest on the front end and design side of website development.  

I discovered a love of debugging while updating my coding skills, which I find very engergizing and satisfying. (Not always in the moment, but when I figure out what went wrong definitely! ðŸ˜„) It is a puzzle I need to sovle once I get started.

I enjoy helping others with their coding and talking code with people of all levels of knowledge.  I also enjoy working in python, which is a language I hadn't coded in before taking the Nucamp bootcamp.  I would like to work with it some more as I haven't really had a chance to much since I was doing it for the bootcamp.

I'm currently in the process of looking for a job to put my updated coding skills to use.  ðŸ“« You can contact me through my linkedin site linkedin.com/in/kwynn-kyd-408b4a230/
